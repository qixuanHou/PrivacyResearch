### Process contract to gather privacy related information <NLP>
It seems like a NLP related problem. It is looking for processing contract automatically and extracting the information related to privacy. Finally, it should be able to formate the unstructured data into a structured way. It also sounds like a web crawler or regular expression problem.

Sample privacy related information includes:
* Breach notification 
* Financial Liability 


### Scan website for subprocessors <NLP>
