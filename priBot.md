### Key contribution
We design and implement Polisis, an approach for au- tomatically annotating previously unseen privacy poli- cies with high-level and fine-grained labels from a pre- specified taxonomy (Sec. 2, 3, 4, and 5).
### Data Layer 
* policy extraction - chrome headless
* list aggregation - convert lists into paragraphs or sentences
* policy segmentation - use "GraphSeg", 
### machine learning layer
#### privacy-specific word embeddings
create word embeddings with "fastText" 
#### classification dataset 
online privacy policies data, is annotated by law students 
#### hierarchical multi-label classification
